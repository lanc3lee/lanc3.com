# Key to pass OSCP & excel in cybersecurity
is to keep developing your own runbooks (or field manuals for various scenarios during your engagements)

With many popular OSCP & CPTS cheatsheets, why bother?

Making your own runbooks help codify set of instructions for different pentesting challenges.

Runbooks help to 
1) detail methods & checklists with steps for specific scenarios
2) track what to do and what you have learnt
3) define an algorithmic approach with clear instructions that can be followed with minimal guesswork

Don't just Try Harder

Hack Smarter. Dive Deeper

Join me along as I develop my runbooks to be documented here

My 90-lab OSCP lab access ended today (12 Jan 2026) & I scheduled my exam on 5 May. 
In next 100+ days, I would tackle > 130+ boxes listed in Lainsunagi's list, developing runbooks along the way.
