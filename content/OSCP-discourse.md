-  don't overcomplicate your methodology... you're always 4-5 commands away from rooting any box you come across
  
- What I felt I did wrong in the start was to thinking too complex. When my mindset changed to this is supposed to be exploited and not super advanced it started to get much easier.
  
- watch the s1ren machine playlist, and follow the ippsec tj null list

- I did the exam 3 times, and I had 2 times the same AD set. It was extremely difficult and got nothing from it. I failed it with 50 & 60 points.
  
  The third time I got another AD set and it was fucking easy, domain admin in less than 3 hours and passed the exam.
  
- Credentials reuse is probably more common in offsec boxes... 
  with OffSec... almost everything revolves around RCE. 
  HTB (CPTS) will misconfigure a service, let you read a config file, get access to sensitive info so you can move laterally. 
  Their exploitation is all about chaining. 
  OffSec has some of that but the chains are more like a string than a long chain. We have to respect the style of both exams.
